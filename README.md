# RaspberryPiBox
This is the ultimate project for raspberry pi.

It is compatible with the Raspberry PI 4, and is completely backwards compatible. 

To set up this project you first need to purchase a raspberry pi. 
Once it arrives leave it in the box, and don't touch it. 
The longer it stays in the more this project will continue to last.


This ends the set up portion of the project.
